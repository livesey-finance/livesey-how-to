# How to Write Documentation for a Repository

### Why Should We Write Well-Readable README?
The README is the first thing a user or developer sees when they get acquainted with your project. A well-written README will help to understand the purpose of the project, its functionality, and the main points such as installation, configuration, and use.

## Table of Contents:
- [Structure](#structure)
  - [Title](#1-title)
  - [Project Description](#2-project-description)
  - [Contents](#3-contents)
  - [Installation](#4-installation)
  - [Usage](#5-usage)

## Structure
A README usually contains the following sections:

- [Title](#1-title)

### 1. Title
The title should clearly reflect the name of the project. For example:

```md

```

### 2. Project Description
This is a brief overview of what your project does and why it's needed. It should be easy for anyone to understand:

```md
## Description

```

### 3. Contents
If your README is long, itâ€™s helpful to include a table of contents:

```md
## Table of Contents

2. [Usage](#usage)
3. [Examples](#examples)
4. [Configuration](#configuration)
5. [Contributing](#contributing)
6. [License](#license)
